# this demonstrates syntax for strings
# in python there is no difference, except for style
# between "string" and 'string'

# double quotes, \n prints a new line
print("This string uses double quotes: ")
print("Hello world!\n")

# single quotes, \n prints a new line
print('This string uses single quotes: ')
print('Suh dude!\n')
